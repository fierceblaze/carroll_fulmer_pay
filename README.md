Carroll Fulmer Tiered Pay Calculator

## Summary

This is a calculator that I created to figure out what my pay would look like based on the miles I
drive.

I originally created a version an iOS only version in Swift with SwiftUI but I lost it the project
code. I decided to recreate the app from scratch in Flutter 3.7.x and I am uploading it to GIT so I
don't loose it again.

## Tax Information

The federal taxes are calculated from the 2023 versions of...

- IRS Publication 15-T: Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods.
- IRS Form W4: Employeeâ€™s Withholding Certificate.

The rest of the taxes I calculated from...

I only implemented single filing status. If this app was for wide release I would have added a tax
settings page but it seems like overkill for a personal tool. This is just for me.

## To Do

- Nothing.
