Carroll Fulmer Tiered Pay Calculator

## Summary

This is a calculator that I created to figure out what my pay would look like based on the miles I
drive.

I originally created a version an iOS only version in Swift with SwiftUI but I lost it the project
code. I decided to recreate the app from scratch in Flutter 3.7.x and I am uploading it to GIT so I
don't loose it again.

There are probably faster and cleaner ways to create this app but this is my first full app in
Flutter so excuse my mess.

## To Do

- Add user data persistence for the text fields.

If this app was for wide release I would add a tax settings page but it seems like overkill for a
personal tool. This is just for me.
